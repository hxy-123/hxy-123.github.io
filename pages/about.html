      I am a fourth-year (2021.09-) Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://xzhou.me/" target="_blank">Xiaowei Zhou</a>. I obtained my bachelor degree in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2021.

      <p></p>
      My research interests focus on 3D computer vision and robotics, with the goal of creating a beautiful AR world and developing highly intelligent embodied systems that can understand the world and accomplish long-horizon tasks. My previous work spans areas including <strong>image matching, point tracking, 3D reconstruction, visual localization, and object pose estimation</strong>.
